# QQL
A project for querying Quranic Text in a Semantic Way. The goal is to create a Quran Query Language that can be used to query the quran to extract more meaningfull and hidden patterns among the text. Furthermore, we should be able to apply some data mining algorithms on top of it. The tool should be usable by mathematicians and data scientists. 

The work done by http://corpus.quran.com is taken as the bases for this. 
Initial idea of what i am trying to achieve can be found here.
